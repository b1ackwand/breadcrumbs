# breadcrumbs
A modular Website Style Guide built with HTML &amp; CSS. Features reusable UI components, color palettes, font previews, breadcrumb navigation.



Website Style Guide
A simple and clean website to showcase essential design tokens and UI components using HTML & CSS.
This project was created as part of my front-end engineering learning path. It demonstrates:

📁 Breadcrumb navigation for better UX and structure

🎨 Color palette using RGB values

🔤 Font collections (Sans Serif, Serif, Monospace, etc.)

🧩 Media & Interactive elements like buttons and an audio player

✨ Neumorphism-inspired UI with soft shadows and a modern layout


Why this matters
It’s more than just a style guide—it's a playground for experimenting with consistent design and reusable components.
This was my way of exploring structure, spacing, and visual hierarchy in a hands-on way. Every section is clickable and intentional!



 Tech used
HTML5

CSS3 (Custom styles + Neumorphism styling)

Local server (e.g., Live Server or Python HTTP server for preview)
